# Participation of FHDO_BCSG at SnakeCLEF 2022

This repository holds code snippets to reproduce the submissions from team FHDO to the SnakeCLEF 2022 (https://www.imageclef.org/SnakeCLEF2022) challenge, which is part of the LifeCLEF (https://www.imageclef.org/LifeCLEF2022) and associated with the CLEF 2022 conference (https://clef2022.clef-initiative.eu/).

The repository contains five subfolders to give code for object detection, prior probability computation of metadata, snake species classification training, inference, and ensemble prediction. A brief description of the implementation details was submitted to the CLEF 2022 working notes. The classification pipeline contains only the parameters used for the best single model, the other models can be adapted by changing the parameters as described in the working notes. The object detection folder also includes the manual annotations of 1,800 images from the SnakeCLEF 2021 dataset.

If there are any problems reproducing the code or adapting parameters, do not hesitate to open an issue or contact us via mail.
